Simple React based podcast player

This is a bit scruffy, was built fairly quickly. I was annoyed at the lack of a simple podcast player that wasn't iTunes so I built this. You can drop in any iTunes compatible podcast XML link and it should allow you to listen to episodes. POC at the moment so expect bugs and a bad UI.
